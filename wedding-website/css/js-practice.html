    // In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:
    //
    //     chickens = 2 legs
    // cows = 4 legs
    // pigs = 4 legs
    // The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.
    // function animals(chickens, cows, pigs) {
    //     return (2 * chickens) + (4 * cows) + (4 * pigs)
    // }
