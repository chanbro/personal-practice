    // Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and return their sum.
    //     function addition(a, b) {
    //     return a + b
    // }

    // In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:
    //
    //     chickens = 2 legs
    // cows = 4 legs
    // pigs = 4 legs
    // The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.
    // function animals(chickens, cows, pigs) {
    //     return (2 * chickens) + (4 * cows) + (4 * pigs)
    // }

    // Fix the code in the code tab to pass this challenge (only syntax errors). Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do.
    // function squaed(b) {
    //     return $a*$a;
    // }
//    Solution: function squared(a) {
//     return a * a
//     }

    // Imagine you run a website that presents users with different coding challenges in levels Easy, Medium, and Hard, where users get points for completing challenges. An Easy challenge is worth five points, a Medium challenge is worth ten points, and a Hard challenge is worth twenty points.
    //
    //     Create a function that takes in the number of each challenge level a user has played and calculates the user's total number of points. Keep in mind that a user cannot complete negative challenges, so the function should return the string "invalid" if any of the passed parameters is negative.
