<h2>How To Play</h2>

**DIE HARDER** _is a text adventure game that will adapt to your choices._ 

<h4>Selection Buttons</h4>
There are buttons with text that appear when it is time for you to make a choice in response to another character or story event. Click on your response to proceed with the game. When there are no story options, select the **NEXT** to progress.

<br>Occasionally, a choice will influence another character’s opinion of you. Keep this in mind when choosing responses— you may need a favor from someone later!<p>

<h4>Items</h4>
You may also come across **[ITEMS]** in the game that you can store to use later. Some items may simply make the game easier by bypassing certain events, while other items are necessary to progress. Keep track of items and think out of the box when you’re in a tricky situation.

<h4>Game Over</h4>
Some choices will lead to a **GAME OVER**, which will take you back to a previous prompt. Evaluate all options carefully before making a choice!

<br>No game over scenario will result in a complete restart of the game. It will take you back to a previously played scenario (a "restart point"). The selections made prior to the restart point will be saved.
